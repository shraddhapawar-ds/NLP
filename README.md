Objective :  Sarcasm detection in news headlines 
Tools and skills used : NLP techniques such as tokenization and Word embeddings, sequential neural 
networks 
o Applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and deep learning to build a sarcasm detection 
model using a labeled dataset of news headlines.  
o Preprocessed textual data, performed tokenization and sequence padding, and utilized GloVe word 
embeddings for semantic representation. Designed and trained a LSTM neural network using 
TensorFlow and Keras, achieving 86% validation accuracy.  
o Employed data analysis, visualization and model evaluation techniques to interpret results and 
optimize performance.
